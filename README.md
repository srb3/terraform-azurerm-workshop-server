# Overview
This module will create azure vms and network security groups in a given resource group (resource group name provided as input variable). It can bootstrap vms of both Linux and Windows flavors with a user and password / ssh key if needed. As for outputs this module will prepare outputs for the terraform-linux-apache-guacamole module's client connections. Allowing you to plumb the instances you create directly as connections in apache guacamole. Note you will need to pass the path to a private key if you want to configure ssh key based access from guacamole to the vms. The instances created by this module are intended for workshops and training labs.

#### Supported platform families:
 * DEBIAN
 * RHEL
 * SUSE
 * WINDOWS

## Usage

```hcl

module "azure_instances_ceate" {
  source           = "srb3/workshop-server/aws"
  version          = "0.0.1"
  ips              = ["172.16.0.23"]
  instance_count   = 1
  user_name        = "jdoe"
  user_public_key  = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" 
  user_private_key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```
